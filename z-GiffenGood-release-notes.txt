Version 3.0 — 10.16.16 — in preparation for University of Missouri, 2/2017
-updated Main Patch (version 06);
-changed [p cuelogic] to [p cuelogic-exNonEx] which allows the assistant to execute JUMP CUEING, to facilitate rehearsals. Qlist’s rewind problem has been solved. Now the user may launch an individual cue mid-piece (from the “p cuez” subpatch) without launching the cues that came before it. (This has only been tested on a few cues, however; there may be further problems due to preloading a sound file a cue earlier, prior to launching that sound file’s cue. If this becomes a problem I will need to redesign the Qlist to reflect this.)
